âœ¨In a galaxy far far away... a nerd emerged after seeing The mandalorian, she threw herself deep into the Star Wars universe and never looked back.

She also decided to learn how to code, here you can find her journey. âœ¨

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Soraia! My journey started with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Biochemistry and Masterâ€™s degree in Production Technologies and Agro-Industrial Transformation, both in FCT NOVA University. Since 2022, I decided to challenge myself to learn how to code with 42Lisboa to change my life and career.
